# Satellite-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow
ðŸš€ A deep learning project using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the EuroSAT dataset. This notebook covers:

âœ… Dataset Preprocessing â€“ Loading and normalizing satellite images
âœ… Model Architecture â€“ A CNN with batch normalization and dropout for regularization
âœ… Data Augmentation â€“ Improving generalization with Keras ImageDataGenerator
âœ… Training & Evaluation â€“ Accuracy, loss plots, confusion matrix, and classification report

ðŸ“Š Results: Achieved 94% accuracy on test data, with insights from precision, recall, and f1-score.

ðŸ”— Technologies Used: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Seaborn
